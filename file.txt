C is an imperative, procedural language in the ALGOL tradition. 
It has a static type system. 
In C, all executable code is contained within subroutines (also called "functions", though not in the sense of functional programming). 
Function parameters are passed by value, although arrays are passed as pointers, i.e. the address of the first item in the array. 
Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing pointers to the thing being referenced.
